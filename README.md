Brief Description: Our app will be a video game where the player’s character crosses Commonwealth Avenue while trying to avoid oncoming traffic. The game begins with the 
character selection screen, from which the player can select a character to control. The character is spawned on a grass area in front of a series of roads and streets 
and can move via the player’s inputs (with arrow keys). Obstacles including pedestrians and vehicles as well as coins also spawn. The player earns a score based on how 
far they travel and the number of coins they pick up. If the player is hit by an obstacle (car, train, pedestrians, etc.), then the game resets, the player’s score is 
saved, and the player can choose to play again.
